  <h1><u>The Evolution of the Indian Education System</u></h1>

        <pre style="font-size:15px ;">The traditions of learning and education in India are as old as the history of civilization.
             Although, the changes in this system have been sluggish but compared to core ideologies from the beginning of the education system,
              the current education system has witnessed a gradual and phenomenal change.

            Education has been embedded in the core beliefs of Indian culture for the development of character in a child and to achieve enlightenment through knowledge to seek salvation.
             The intellectual enrichment of children was always among the foremost priorities in Indian culture. If we look closer, 
              we find that the Evolution of the Indian Education System can be Segregated into three broad phases, namely:
            
            The Vedic Education System
            The Islamic Education System
            The English Education System</pre><br>
       
            <h2>Vedic Education System </h2>
            <p>In the popular consensus, it is believed that the Vedic Education System emerged around 1500BCE and lasted till 500BCE, although the influence of the Vedic education system can be witnessed 
                till the 13th century A.D. The Vedic education emphasized two ideas of Knowledge: “this-worldly knowledge” and the “Other-worldly knowledge”, through sets of four Vedas- Rigveda, Samveda, 
                Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. The core of Vedic education was to achieve high ideals in an individual’s
                 life through self-realization. Realization means Knowledge and experience which starts with knowing the self. Self does not mean the individual, instead, it is the supreme self.
                  The influx of spiritual and religious teaching became the source of the origin of Hindu philosophy.

                The Vedic education system was imparted to the student, called Shisyas under the supervision of “Guru”, in a secluded place, far away from 
                the urbanization, known as Gurukul. Student life was considered as a life of Tapasya or Meditation. A student, being a Brahmacharya has to develop virtues like
                morality, brahmacharya (celibacy) sacrifice, simplicity, honesty, service, dutifulness, modesty, freedom from conceit. Also, a student should give up bad habits like indulgence, 
                selfishness, luxury, enjoyment, pleasure, etc. He had to develop purity of character</p><br>



                <h2>  Islamic Education System</h2>
                <p>After the conquest of the Indian Subcontinent by the Muslims during the  Late Medieval period and Early Modern period, the traditional
                     methods of education were deeply influenced by Islamic teaching. Rulers of the Delhi Sultanate such as Qutb-ud-din Aybak and other Muslim rulers initiated 
                     institutions that imparted religious knowledge. Scholars such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Moinuddin Chishti were credited for the establishment of Islamic monasteries 
                     attracting
                      students from Bukhara and Afghanistan to study humanities and science in India.

                    Traditional madrassas and Kuttabs were the Islamic centres for teaching grammar, philosophy, mathematics, and law influenced by the Greek traditions 
                    inherited by Persia and the Middle East before Islam spread from these regions into India</p><br>

         <h2>English Education System</h2>
         <p>After the British East India Company began its expansion in the Indian subcontinent, a need for utilitarian education was
             felt for the common masses to enhance the communication between the British rule and its subject
             The colonial-era education system continued to prevail up until two decades,post-independence. In 1968, the Indira Gandhi government brought
              the first National Policy on Education Based on the report and recommendations of the Kothari Commission (1964–1966) proposing Radical restructuring of the Education system to achieve 
              national integration and greater cultural and economic development.

In 1986, the second national policy of education was implemented by the government led by Rajiv Gandhi. The new policy focused on “special emphasis on the removal of disparities and to equalize 
educational opportunity,” especially for Indian women and the backward classes of society. Various significant measures were taken to achieve these goals of social integration 
like scholarship policies, 
adult education, and demand for a child-centred approach in primary education.</p><br>

<h2>New Education Policy</h2>
<p> most recent New Education Policy was announced by the government in 2020, under the leadership of  Narendra Modi. The changes proposed in these policies allow the student to
     be flexible in their pursuit of Knowledge while calling for an emphasis on the upliftment 
    of the Mother tongue. It also suggests, a revision of the curriculum and pedagogical structure from a 10+2 system to a 5+3+3+4 system design to elevate
     learning for students based on the intellectual development of children.</p>
