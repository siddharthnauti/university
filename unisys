<center><h1><b>Evolution of State Universities in India </b></h1></center>
<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
    <li>State universities are public universities run by the state government, 
    and are  established by a local legislative assembly act.</li>

    <li>The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of state universities.
    As of 4 March 2021, the UGC lists 443 state universities.
    The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, 
    the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai.</li>
    
    
    <li>the UGC categorizes state universities as either "declared fit to receive Central/UGC assistance under Section 12 (B)
     of the UGC Act–1956", or not, and notes this status at the lists published. Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of 
     the UGC and published in the minutes.</li>
    
    
   <li> Other types of universities controlled by the UGC include: Central universities, or Union universities are established by
     Act of Parliament </li>
    and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Union Human Resource Development Ministry.
   <li> Deemed university, or "Deemed-to-be-University", is a status of autonomy granted by the Department of Higher Education
     on the advice of the UGC, under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956.
    Private universities are approved by the UGC. They can grant degrees but they are not allowed to have off-campus affiliated colleges.</li>
    
   <li> Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. 
    These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organizations"
     or "autonomous institutes".</li>
   <li> They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education.
    These organizations include the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology,
     the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Management
    and other autonomous institutes.</li>
