<center><h1><b>Evolution of Private Universities in India </b></h1></center>
<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
   

    <li>In a country where education is still not universal in access but demand is huge, private universities have seen a phenomenal growth over the last half decade, 
        largely outpacing the other kinds of universities.
The number of private universities in India jumped to 407 in 2019-20 from 276 in 2015-16, data from the latest All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) 2019-20 showed. 
Apart from these 131 private universities, more are set to begin soon.</li><br>
    
    
    <li>This 47 per cent rise significantly outpaced the growth of all universities
         (private and public) — up 30.5 per cent to 1,043 currently from 799 in 2015-16.</li><br>
    
    
   <li> The analysis based on the AISHE Report showed that “in the last few years, an average of 1000+ colleges have been set up in India year after year, out of which
     more than 80 percent are private establishments while the remaining come under the ambit of the government-funded institutions”.</li><br>
    
   <li> According to the government, education institutions are broadly classified into six categories — state public university, state private university, deemed private university and deemed public university, central university and institute of national importance.

    While each of the categories saw growth over the five-year period, the most considerable rise came in the state private university category. Most of the private players set up 
    universities under this segment — growing 66 per cent to 327 in 2019-20 from 197 in 2015-16.</li>
